# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the LifeBox IoT Platform. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the development of the system.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams:

- **Document the reasoning** behind architectural choices
- **Maintain historical context** for future developers
- **Track the evolution** of system architecture
- **Enable informed decision-making** based on past experiences

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent structure:

1. **Title**: A short descriptive title
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: The situation that led to this decision
4. **Decision**: The architectural decision made
5. **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes

## Creating New ADRs

To create a new ADR:

1. **Determine the next ADR number** by checking the latest ADR in this directory
2. **Use the template**: Copy `template.md` and rename it with the appropriate number and title
3. **Fill in all sections** with relevant information
4. **Update this README** to include the new ADR in the index
5. **Submit for review** through the normal PR process

## ADR Statuses

- **üü° Proposed**: Under discussion and review
- **‚úÖ Accepted**: Decision has been made and is being implemented
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated**: No longer recommended but still in use
- **‚ùå Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR

## Guidelines

- **Keep ADRs immutable**: Don't modify ADRs after they're accepted. Create new ones instead.
- **Be concise but complete**: Include enough detail for future developers to understand the decision.
- **Focus on the "why"**: The reasoning is more important than the "what".
- **Include alternatives**: Document what options were considered and why they were rejected.
- **Update status when needed**: Mark ADRs as deprecated or superseded when appropriate.
